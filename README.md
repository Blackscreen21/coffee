# coffee☕️

If you are as nerdy about coffee as I am the following situation may feel familiar to you:

+ Craving Filter Coffee
+ putting 250/500 ml water on the stove | in the kettle
+ Realizing you forgot the ratio of coffee to water you want
<br>
I am honestly a little sick of constantly googling or looking up the ratio in one of James Hoffmann's books.
<br>

Currently I also am flirting with the idea of having default recepies in general but also being able to store grind sizes, ratios etc. for specific beans, as these can be entirely different from bag to bag (in cheap coffee even from bean to bean)

I am aware apps like these exist already but they dont excell in design and as Linus Torvalds once said "The […] philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it."
